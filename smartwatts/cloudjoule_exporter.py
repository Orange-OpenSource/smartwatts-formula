Prometheus Exporter for cloudjoule (powerapi inside k8s)


"""

class CloudJoulePrometheusDB(BasePrometheusDB):

    """
    Database that expose received data as metric in order to be scrapped by a prometheus instance
    Can only be used with a pusher actor.

    The exporter exposes one gauge and one counter metric
    * for rapl energy (total cpu energy usage)
    * for the global energy usage estimated by powerAPI
    * for the estimated energy usage of each pod 
    
    the pod metrics contain:
    * the pod name : `pod_name`
    * the pod namespace : `pod_name_space`
    * the name of the sensor
    * the k8s target (something like `/kubepods/besteffort/pod<uid>/<uid>`)
    * a subset of the k8s labels of the pod 
      * specified using the `tags` argument in the constructor
      * their value is empty for pods that do not have these labels
      * the name id prepended with `label_` . E.g. for a pod holding the k8s label `app=application-2`, the 
        prometheus metric will have a tag `label_app="application-2"`

    Example of the pod energy counter : 
    ```
    cloudjoule_pod_joule_total{label_app="application-2",label_env="",label_k8s_app="",label_service="",pod_name="application-2-5ff95cdbf5-h9xzz",pod_namespace="application-2",sensor="sensor_test",target="/kubepods/besteffort/pod9d7592ea-f1da-4ead-982f-4cd30bb0e1b5/bec1f163e3e1c5ecb019c55034c169df59cd1c489cf276dc4d22e6ab5f1c0bf9"} 0.0

    Fix k8s label names, returns a dict { original_name : fixed_name}.

    When using k8s label names as label names for prometheus, we run into issues
    as they have different rules regarding allowed characters.

    Prometheus:
    * must match regexp `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`
    * https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels

    Kubernetes:
    * "The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less,
       beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z])
       with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. [...]"
    * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set

    To avoid this issue we convert characters not allowed in prometheus
    to underscore. We also prepend "label_" in front of the label name.

    With these rules, we can into conflicts when different k8s label names are
    converted to the same prometheus label name. In that case we flag
    these conflicts by adding `_conflict{1}` to the name. This matches
    what is done by kube-state-metrics:
