"""
This module supports configuring some key parameter using environment variables.
This is useful, and recommended (cf. twelve-factor app), when running in a environment where changing 
the configuration file across deployments (e.g. k8s in our case).

At the moment, only a subset of configuration parameters are supported.
It's currently quite a hack and should probably be merged with the existing 
configuration mechanism, which currently supports file and cli arguments.
